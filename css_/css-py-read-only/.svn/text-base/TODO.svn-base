TODO: Comments should be returned by the tokenizer so the parser can determine 
whether to ignore them. This means the parser needs to allow COMMENT tokens at
arbitrary locations.

TODO: Add the ability to dereference the URI in an @import rule and to 
(recursively) parse and inline the declarations from the referenced 
stylesheet. (Working, but needs to be optional.)

TODO: Add more options to the css-parse script.

TODO: Be less strict about from parsing errors, such as malformed 
delcarations, which the CSS 2.1 specification states a user agent MUST ignore.

TODO: Coalesce and minimize declarations into their “shortcut” variants, e.g.
“border” instead of “border-width,” “border-color,” etc.
